## 🍃 CHAPTER FOURTEEN - *ENTRUSTING*

### 於是佛告彌勒菩薩言：「彌勒！我今以是無量億阿僧祇劫所集阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法，付囑於汝。如是輩經，於佛滅後末世之中，汝等當以神力，廣宣流布於閻浮提，無令斷絕。所以者何？未來世中，當有善男子、善女人，及天、龍、鬼神、乾闥婆、羅剎等，發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心，樂于大法；若使不聞如是等經，則失善利。如此輩人，聞是等經，必多信樂，發希有心，當以頂受，隨諸眾生所應得利，而為廣說。

At this time, the Buddha told Maitreya Bodhisattva, “Maitreya! I now bestow on you this Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, which I have accumulated over immeasurable *koṭis* of *asaṃkhyeyas* of *kalpas*. Sutras of this kind should, during the final period after my Nirvana, be circulated extensively throughout Jambudvīpa by you and others with your spiritual power so as not to be cut off. Why? In a future time, there will be good men and good women, as well as devas, nagas, ghosts and spirits, gandharvas, rakṣasas, and so on, who will generate *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi citta* and take pleasure in the great Dharma. If they are unable to hear sutras such as this, they will lose its good benefit. When these type of people hear these sutras, they must with great faith and joy realize their rarity and accept them with humility, explaining them extensively according to the benefits that sentient beings will receive from them.”

### 「彌勒當知！菩薩有二相。何謂為二？一者，好於雜句文飾之事；二者，不畏深義如實能入。若好雜句文飾事者，當知是為新學菩薩；若於如是無染無著甚深經典，無有恐畏，能入其中，聞已心淨，受持讀誦，如說修行，當知是為久修道行。

“Maitreya, you should know! Bodhisattvas have two characteristics. What are these two? 1. They are good with miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishments; and 2. Their lack of fear of penetrating deeply into the actualities of profound meanings. You should know that it is novice bodhisattvas who are good with miscellaneous phrases and literary embellishment. Those who lack the fear of entering into profound sutras that are without defilement and without attachment, and who upon hearing them become pure in mind and accept and maintain, read and recite, and practice them as explained—you should understand that these [bodhisattvas] have been cultivating the path for a long time.”

### 「彌勒！復有二法，名新學者，不能決定於甚深法。何等為二？一者，所未聞深經，聞之驚怖生疑，不能隨順，毀謗不信，而作是言：『我初不聞。從何所來？』二者，若有護持解說如是深經者，不肯親近、供養、恭敬，或時於中說其過惡。有此二法，當知是為新學菩薩，為自毀傷，不能於深法中，調伏其心。

“Maitreya! There are two things (*dharmas*) regarding how those who are called novices unable to be definite about the extremely profound Dharma. What are these two? 1. When they hear profound sutras for the first time, they become fearful, generate doubts, and are unable to follow them. Reviling them and lacking faith in them, they say ‘I have not heard this before. Where did it come from?’; and 2. When there are those who defend, maintain, and explain profound sutras such as these, they are unable to associate with them, make offerings to them, and revere them. Or, at times they talk about their transgressions and errors. You should know, those who have these two dharmas are novice bodhisattvas. They only harm themselves, and they are unable to control their minds within the profound Dharma.”

### 「彌勒！復有二法，菩薩雖信解深法，猶自毀傷，而不能得無生法忍。何等為二？一者，輕慢新學菩薩，而不教誨；二者，雖解深法，而取相分別。是為二法。」

“Maitreya! There are also two other things concerning bodhisattvas who devoutly understand the profound Dharma, but who still harm themselves and are unable to attain the patient tolerance for the birthlessness of dharmas. What are these two? 1. They belittle novice bodhisattvas and do not instruct them; and 2. They understand the profound Dharma, but with a discrimination that grasps at characteristics. These are the two dharmas.”

### 彌勒菩薩聞說是已，白佛言：「世尊！未曾有也。如佛所說，我當遠離如斯之惡，奉持如來無數阿僧祇劫所集阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法。若未來世善男子、善女人求大乘者，當令手得如是等經，與其念力，使受持讀誦、為他廣說。世尊！若後末世，有能受持讀誦、為他說者，當知皆是彌勒神力之所建立。」

When Maitreya Bodhisattva heard this explanation he addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! This is unprecedented. It is as you have explained. I will far transcend such evils and maintain the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* that the Thus Come One has accumulated over innumerable *asaṃkhyeyas* of *kalpas*. If, in the future, there are good men and good women who seek the Great Vehicle, I will make certain that they get hold of such sutras. Using their power of mindfulness, I will cause them to receive and maintain, read and recite, and extensively explain them for others. World-honored One! If, in latter times, there are those able to receive, maintain, read, recite, and explain them for others, one should understand that these will all be established by Maitreya’s spiritual power.”

### 佛言：「善哉，善哉！彌勒！如汝所說，佛助爾喜。」

The Buddha said, “Excellent, excellent! Maitreya! It is as you have explained. I am delighted!” 

### 於是一切菩薩合掌白佛：「我等亦於如來滅後，十方國土廣宣流布阿耨多羅三藐三菩提法，復當開導諸說法者，令得是經。」

At this all the bodhisattvas held their palms together and addressed the Buddha, “We too, after the Buddha’s nirvana, will extensively disseminate the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* throughout the lands of the ten directions. We will also guide those who explain the Dharma and cause them to obtain this sutra.”

### 爾時四天王白佛言：「世尊！在在處處、城邑聚落、山林曠野，有是經卷，讀誦解說者，我當率諸官屬，為聽法故，往詣其所，擁護其人，面百由旬，令無伺求得其便者。」

Then the four heavenly kings addressed the Buddha saying, “World-honored One! In every place, whether city, village, mountain forest, or wilderness, where there are those who read and recite and explain the chapters of this sutra, we will lead our palace retinues to those places to listen to the Dharma and protect those people. For an area of a hundred *yojanas* we will make it convenient to find without seeking.”

### 是時佛告阿難：「受持是經，廣宣流布。」

At this time the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Accept and maintain this sutra, and disseminate it extensively.”

### 阿難言：「唯然！我已受持要者。世尊！當何名斯經？」

Ānanda said, “So shall it be! I have already accepted and maintained its essentials. World-honored One! What is the name of this sutra?”

### 佛言：「阿難！是經名為『維摩詰所說』，亦名『不可思議解脫法門』，如是受持。」

The Buddha said, “Ānanda! This sutra is called the ‘Discourse of Vimalakīrti.’ It is also called the ‘Inconceivable Liberation Dharma Door.’ As such you should accept and maintain it.”

### 佛說是經已，長者維摩詰、文殊師利、舍利弗、阿難等，及諸天、人、阿修羅一切大眾，聞佛所說，皆大歡喜。

When the Buddha finished explaining this sutra, the Elder Vimalakīrti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the great congregations of devas, humans, and asuras, hearing what the Buddha had explained, were all greatly pleased.
